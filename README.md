Hi, I'm Nik. I'm a British jazz musician and web developer currently living in Brazil.
Having learnt html, css, and responsive web design, I'm currently adding Javascript to my skills.
I'd love to collaborate on html/css and/or Javascript projects.
You can reach me at nik@nikpayton.com or nikpayton@gmail.com
